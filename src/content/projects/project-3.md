title: Object-Detecting and Self-Balancing Mobile Robot
description: A two-wheeled self-balancing robot capable of staying stable on flat surfaces and slopes up to 10°. Used CAD for mechanical design and C++ based PID control for balancing algorithm, and integrated real-time image processing with PyTorch and OpenCV to stream, detect, and classify common objects. Additionally, I created an iOS app using Flutter framework for Bluetooth remote control.
